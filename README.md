## Installation with CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries.

``` ruby
pod "ZYDatePickerController"
```

## Usage

It is quite easy to use, you can use this by two methods, one is for block, another is for delegate.

### block

``` objc

__weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
ZYDatePickerController *datePickController = [[ZYDatePickerController alloc] initWithMessage:NSLocalizedString(@"pleaseChooseDate", nil) dateFormat:@"yyyy-MM-dd" handler:^(NSString *dateString) {
    __strong typeof(weakSelf) strongSelf = weakSelf;
    strongSelf.textField.text = dateString;
}];
[self presentViewController:datePickController animated:YES completion:nil];

```

### delegate

the delegate example comes sooner
